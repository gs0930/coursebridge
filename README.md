Coursebridge is an application aimed at enhancing student collaboration and connection at Wellesley. The user base consists of Wellesley College students, with accounts verified by their school email for authentication. Users of Coursebridge will have access to three main pages: the home page, an accounts list page, and personal pages. The home page has a feed of posts categorized by one of three tags: “Discuss Homework,” “Grab a Lunch/Socialize,” or “Study Session.” Users can filter and search posts by tags, timestamps, or other keyword information included in the post. Interactions with a post of interest take the form of a comment or a request for the author’s contact information.
